## üèóÔ∏è **Key Features**
- **Target IP Selection:**  
  Manually select a target IP address and validate it. Automatically scans devices on the same network and allows you to choose a target from the list.
  
- **File Validation:**  
  Ensures all necessary files are present and intact when the project starts, guaranteeing smooth operation.

## üîç **Modules and Features**

### **1. Network Module**
- Performs **Nmap-based** network scanning to detect open ports and services on the target system.
- Scans devices on the same network, listing their IP addresses and basic details.
- Easily select a target IP address from the generated list.
- Saves all scan results to log files in an organized manner.

### **2. Vulnerability Module**
- Analyzes data from network scans to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Creates a vulnerability map of the target system and logs the results.

### **3. Attack Module**
- **XSS:** Tests for Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **SQL Injection:** Analyzes the target for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **DoS:** Simulates Denial of Service attacks to test service availability.
- **MITM:** Conducts Man-in-the-Middle attack scenarios for analysis.
- **Brute Force:** Attempts password cracking on SSH, FTP, and URL-based services.

### **4. Directory Discovery Module**
- Scans the target web server to discover hidden directories and files.
- Uses custom or predefined wordlists for brute-forcing directory paths.
- Logs all discovered directories and their HTTP response codes.
- Provides an organized output for easier analysis.
